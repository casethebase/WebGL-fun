## 1,048,576 Particles

An experiment showing 1 million+ particles being moved around on the GPU via WebGL.
All data is uploaded once - velocities are computed and integrated entirely on the GPU and state is preserved via a Texture and Framebuffer. 
You can also control this with LEAP motion if you have one :)
